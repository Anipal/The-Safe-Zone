# The-Safe-Zone
## Introduction 
Time to time it has been stressed upon that the restoration process after a natural disaster is just as challenging as the rescue operation. Even afer being rescued millions die because of lack of proper treatment, food, water and sanitation. Various rescue camps are set up by the government but due to the lack of proper resources they are not able to serve up to their potential. Lack of information regarding the location of the rescue camps also play a major role in the death of many.  Our application is aimed at making the safe zone management process more efficient so that more lives can be saved. 

## Features

Following are some of the features we aim to deploy in our application -

1) Everyone with the application will get all information regarding friends and family, the application will show whether a friend or family member has reached the rescue camp. In this manner the locals can also help in rescue operations since the application will give them the exact location of the rescuees.

2) The application will also show the location of the nearest rescue camp, in case some civilian wants to declare his/her house as a rescue center that too can be done using the application.

3) Each rescue camp will input data regarding the supplies and services they require along with the number of people accomodated in each rescue camp. Each camp will also enter the information regarding each person accomodated, information will include name, address and phone number.
The rescue camps can also declare whether they have been overflooded with rescuees for better management. All of this data will be accessible to the government and nearby NGOâ€™s who can help in the relief operations by providing the necessary supplies and servces.
