    <string name="ab">In India, where there is currently a very unorganised and distributed emergency services system , with different states having different helplines for medical criminal or arson emergencies, an app which integrates all of them together under one quick, responsive and easy to use app.

(Many cities have 100 facility but most of them have very poor response time and sometimes no respone at all)

    Having a integrated app ensures that their concerns are addressed to the authorities.</string>

    <string name="About">Reliable, better response time, informative, multiplatform integration.</string>
